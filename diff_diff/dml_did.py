"""DMLDiD: Double/Debiased Machine Learning DiD (Chang 2020), staggered.

Implements Chang (2020, The Econometrics Journal 23(2), 177-191) as a
staggered ATT(g,t) estimator: each Callaway-Sant'Anna style (g, t) cell is
a 2-period Chang problem. ``panel=True`` (default) runs Case 1 (repeated
outcomes) — cross-fitted nuisances (propensity ``g_hat`` and control
outcome-change regression ``m_hat``), the Neyman-orthogonal score
``psi_1`` (``chang_panel_score``), and the augmented-score plug-in
variance (``chang_panel_score_augmented``;
``SE = sqrt(mean(psi_bar**2)/n)``). ``panel=False`` runs Case 2 (declared
repeated cross sections) — level outcomes, the single control-only
``(T - lam_hat) * Y`` outcome nuisance (``chang_rcs_score``), and the
λ-corrected Theorem 2 variance (``chang_rcs_score_augmented``). The
classic 2-period design is the degenerate single-cell case. Covariates
are REQUIRED (Chang's estimator exists for the high-dimensional-X
setting; use CallawaySantAnna without covariates).

``DMLDiD`` writes the CallawaySantAnna per-(g,t) ``influence_func_info``
payload (per-sampling-unit entries ``psi_bar_i / n_cell`` — per unit on
panel fits, per observation on RCS fits — so ``sqrt(sum(if**2))`` IS the
cell SE on no-design fits; under ``survey_design=``/``cluster=`` the
payload is the weighted-IF analogue ``w_i * psi_bar_i / sum(w)`` and the
per-cell SE is the design-based CR1/weighted-IF variance instead) and
inherits the CS aggregation + multiplier-bootstrap mixins: event study
with sup-t bands, group/simple aggregation (plus total on panel
non-survey fits; RCS and declared-survey fits fail ``total`` closed), and
post-fit ``results.aggregate()`` with bootstrap replay.

See docs/methodology/REGISTRY.md "DMLDiD" for equations, implementation
Notes (global p-hat, D-stratified folds, pooled fold weighting, trimming,
skip-reason vocabulary) and the DoubleML parity anchors.

    """Chang (2020) DML DiD: staggered ATT(g,t) with cross-fitted ML nuisances.

    ``panel=True`` (default) estimates Case 1 on panel data; ``panel=False``
    estimates Case 2 on declared repeated cross sections (level outcomes,
    λ-corrected variance).

    Per (g, t) cell: K-fold cross-fitting of the propensity
    (``propensity_learner``, out-of-fold ``predict_proba``) and the
    control-only outcome regression (``outcome_learner``, trained on the
    cell's controls, Chang's ``I_kz^c``), then the pooled orthogonal score
    mean and the augmented-score plug-in SE. On panel fits the folds are
    D-stratified and the outcome nuisance is the outcome-change regression
    ``E[dY | X, D=0]``; on RCS fits the folds are D x T stratified and the
    nuisance is the level regression ``E[(T - lam)Y | X, D=0]`` with the
    lambda-corrected variance. (Under a survey/cluster design whose PSU is
    strictly coarser than the sampling unit, folds are PSU-COHESIVE
    instead of stratified, and the per-cell SE is design-based rather than
    the plug-in ``sqrt(mean(psi_bar**2)/n)``; declared designs also weight
    the moments — REGISTRY DMLDiD survey Notes.) Aggregation (event study,
    group, simple; plus total on panel non-survey fits — RCS and
    declared-survey fits fail ``total`` closed) is POST-FIT via
    ``results.aggregate()``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    propensity_learner : str or object, default "logit"
        ``"logit"``, or ANY object with ``fit``/``predict_proba`` (the
        classifier protocol) — e.g. a user-constructed or sklearn estimator.
        String names select library defaults only.
    outcome_learner : str or object, default "linear"
        ``"linear"``, ``"ridge"``, ``"sieve"``, or ANY object with
        ``fit``/``predict`` (the regressor protocol).
    n_folds : int, default 5
        Cross-fitting folds K (DML2; per-cell assignment).
    control_group : str, default "never_treated"
        ``"never_treated"`` or ``"not_yet_treated"`` (CS semantics).
    anticipation : int, default 0
        Anticipation periods (shifts the base period and the
        not-yet-treated threshold; CS semantics).
    alpha : float, default 0.05
        Significance level.
    n_bootstrap : int, default 0
        Multiplier-bootstrap iterations (0 = analytical inference).
    bootstrap_weights : str, optional
        ``"rademacher"`` (default), ``"mammen"``, or ``"webb"``.
    seed : int, optional
        Root seed for the per-cell fold draws and the bootstrap. With
        ``seed=None``, POINT ESTIMATES vary across fits — cross-fitting
        draws random folds; set ``seed`` for reproducible results with the
        library's deterministic built-in learners. The same seed yields
        DIFFERENT folds with vs without a coarser-than-unit PSU design
        (PSU-cohesive folds consume the RNG differently than stratified
        folds — a config change, not a reproducibility break). A user-supplied
        STOCHASTIC learner object must additionally be seeded by the user
        (e.g. sklearn ``random_state``) — ``cross_fit_predict`` deep-copies
        the learner template where copyable but never seeds its internal
        RNG.
    base_period : str, default "varying"
        ``"varying"`` or ``"universal"`` (CS semantics; universal
        materializes per-cohort zero reference cells).
    cband : bool, default True
        Uniform (sup-t) bands on the post-fit event-study aggregation's
        bootstrap replay.
    pscore_trim : float, default 0.01
        Propensity clip bound: fitted propensities are clipped to
        ``[pscore_trim, 1 - pscore_trim]`` after the extremeness warning
        (clip, never drop; Chang's paper gives no trimming rule). Must be in
        ``(0, 0.5)`` and large enough that ``1 - pscore_trim < 1`` in
        float64 (a sub-ulp trim would disable the upper clip).
    panel : bool, default True
        ``True`` estimates Chang's Case 1 (repeated outcomes) on panel data
        (one row per unit-period, cell score on outcome CHANGES). ``False``
        estimates Case 2 (repeated cross sections) on DECLARED
        cross-sectional data — one observation per row with a row-unique
        ``unit`` ID, cell score on outcome LEVELS with the post-period
        sampling share λ̂ and the λ-corrected Theorem 2 variance. Case 2
        additionally assumes stationary cross-sectional sampling (Chang
        Assumption 2.3: each wave samples the SAME target population —
        the composition of ``(D, X)`` is stable across waves, while
        outcomes are the period-specific potential outcomes, so trends
        and treatment effects are expected, not violations), which is not
        data-checkable — ``fit()`` warns. ``aggregate('total')`` is unavailable on RCS fits (fails
        closed, the library-wide RC convention).
    cluster : str, optional
        Column name for COARSER-than-unit clustering. The column is
        synthesized into a ``SurveyDesign(psu=cluster)`` (or injected as
        the PSU of a declared PSU-less design): it drives PSU-cohesive
        cross-fitting folds (when strictly coarser than the sampling
        unit), the per-cell cluster-robust SE, the bootstrap draw
        structure, and ``df_inference`` — while the moment kernels stay
        UNWEIGHTED and no ``sample_weight`` reaches the learners. When
        ``survey_design=`` also supplies a PSU, the design's PSU wins
        (warning on differing partitions).

        ``unit_cohorts``, ``canonical_size`` = n_obs — the aggregation and
        bootstrap mixins branch off exactly these (per-row multiplier
        weights; per-obs cohort bincount pg basis; ``aggregate('total')``
        fails closed on ``is_panel: False``).

        ``agg_cohort_masses`` is deliberately NOT set: under unique row IDs
        the aggregation cache's bincount fallback yields exactly the fixed
        per-cohort row masses (never-treated included, denominator = n_obs),
        so the WIF pg basis is already the fixed-cohort-mass one and the
        per-cell ``agg_weight`` (from ``rcs_cohort_masses``, int-keyed by the
        canonical labels) aligns the point-estimate weights with it.
        Supplying the key would be a numeric no-op that routes lookups
        through float()-keyed dict access, where distinct int64 cohorts
        above 2**53 (admissible through 2**62 by the label pipeline)
        collide. That rationale HOLDS under survey too: the survey branches
        of ``fixed_cohort_agg_weights`` (native-key dict) and
        ``_get_agg_cache`` (bincount) are collision-free, so survey cohort
        masses flow without ``agg_cohort_masses``. ``obs_per_unit`` stays
        omitted (true RCS is one row per unit — a non-None obs_per_unit
        would divide the WIF). Survey keys: on RCS the rows ARE the
        sampling units, so ``resolved_survey_unit`` is the per-obs design
        itself (CS RCS precedent) and ``survey_weights`` are the per-obs
        weights; ``rcs_cohort_masses`` stays unweighted (the per-cell
        ``agg_weight`` becomes an inert fallback — survey masses win in
        the aggregation cache).

            Complex survey design (pweight-only). Declared designs weight
            the moment kernels (Hajek p-hat/lambda-hat/theta) and pass
            ``sample_weight`` into the nuisance learners (user learner
            objects must accept ``sample_weight`` by keyword — a learner
            without it is rejected up front). Two variance lanes:
            full-design TSL (weights/strata/PSU/FPC) switches cross-fitting
            to PSU-cohesive folds when the PSU is strictly coarser than the
            sampling unit and routes the per-cell and aggregate variances
            through the design-based kernels with ``df = n_PSU - n_strata``
            t-inference; replicate-weight designs (BRR / Fay / JK1 / JKn /
            SDR) compute per-cell AND aggregate variances by IF-reweighting
            the cross-fitted scores with ``df = rank(replicate matrix) - 1``
            t-inference (nuisances are not re-estimated per replicate;
            REGISTRY DMLDiD Note). Replicate designs reject ``cluster=``
            and ``n_bootstrap > 0`` combinations. Survey support is a
            documented library extension of Chang (2020), which assumes
            i.i.d. sampling — Theorem 2's coverage claim does not carry
            over (REGISTRY DMLDiD Notes).
