"""Shared helpers for BusinessReport and DiagnosticReport.

This module hosts per-estimator dispatch logic that both BR and DR
consume. It lives in its own module rather than in ``business_report``
or ``diagnostic_report`` to avoid a circular-import risk: BR already
imports from DR (for ``DiagnosticReportResults``), so placing shared
helpers here keeps the dependency graph tidy if DR ever needs to
reference a BR symbol.

Current contents:

- ``describe_target_parameter(results)`` — returns the
  ``target_parameter`` block documenting what scalar the headline
  represents. Introduced for BR/DR gap #6 (target-parameter
  clarity); see ``docs/methodology/REPORTING.md`` and per-estimator
  entries in ``docs/methodology/REGISTRY.md`` for the canonical
  wording.

def describe_target_parameter(results: Any) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Return the target-parameter block for a fitted result.

    The block names what scalar the headline number actually
    represents (overall ATT, DID_M, dose-response ATT(d|d), etc.) so
    BR/DR output is self-contained. Baker et al. (2026) Step 2 is
    "Define the target parameter"; this helper does that work for the

    Each per-estimator branch cites REGISTRY.md as the single source
    of truth for the canonical wording (per
    ``feedback_verify_claims.md``). All wording choices are
    deliberate:

    - ``ImputationDiD`` / ``TwoStageDiD``: horizon / group tables come
      from post-fit ``results.aggregate('event_study'/'group')`` since
      3.9 (the fit-time ``aggregate`` kwarg is deprecated) and never
      change ``overall_att``. The headline is always the sample-mean
      overall ATT (per BJS 2024 Step 3 with ``w_it = 1/N_1``);
      disambiguate via the event-study or group aggregate if you need
      the horizon / group target.
    - ``CallawaySantAnna``: ``overall_att`` is cohort-size-weighted
      across post-treatment ``ATT(g, t)`` cells regardless of the
      fit-time ``aggregate`` kwarg. The event-study / group tables are
      produced post-fit via ``results.aggregate('event_study'/'group')``
      (the deprecated fit-time ``aggregate=`` kwarg populates the legacy
      ``event_study_effects`` / ``group_effects`` fields until 4.0).
    - ``ContinuousDiD``: the regime (PT vs. SPT) is a user-level
      assumption, not a library setting. The ``definition`` names
      both regime readings (``ATT^loc`` under PT,
      ``ATT^glob`` under SPT) so the user can pick the
      interpretation that matches their assumption.
    - ``WooldridgeDiD``: ``overall_att`` depends on the fit-time
      ``method`` — for OLS ETWFE (``method="ols"``) it is the
      observation-count-weighted average of ``ATT(g, t)``
      coefficients from the saturated regression; for nonlinear
      ETWFE (``method="logit"`` / ``"poisson"``) it is the
      average-structural-function (ASF) contrast across cohort x
      time cells. Both paths preserve ``overall_att`` across
      ``.aggregate("event_study")`` calls (which only populate additional
      event-study tables).
