    Builds the per-(g,t) per-index IF vector from ``inf_info`` and routes
    through ``compute_survey_if_variance`` so that the per-cell variance
    inherits the SAME design-based machinery as the aggregate path:

        V = sum_h (1 - f_h) * (n_h / (n_h - 1)) * sum_j (psi_hj - psi_h_bar)^2

    where ``psi_hj = sum_{i in PSU j, stratum h} psi_i``. This matches
    the documented CR1 contract in REGISTRY.md (synthesized
    ``SurveyDesign(psu=cluster)`` → ``_compute_stratified_psu_meat``)
    and applies the G/(G-1) finite-sample correction, PSU centering,
    FPC, and lonely-PSU handling uniformly with overall / event-study
    inference.

    For the panel path, ``resolved_survey`` is ``resolved_survey_unit``
    (length n_units) and the IF index space is per-unit. For the RCS
    path, ``resolved_survey`` is the per-obs ``resolved_survey`` (length
    n_obs). The helper is index-space agnostic — it just requires
    ``treated_idx`` / ``control_idx`` in ``inf_info`` to be valid
    offsets into ``resolved_survey.psu``.

      variance unidentified, e.g., G<2 or lonely-PSU removed all strata).
      Caller MUST propagate this NaN through to ``safe_inference`` so
      the per-cell inference surface (se / t_stat / p_value / conf_int)
      is NaN-consistent — NEVER fall back to the unit-level SE. Falling
      back would silently report a different estimator's variance under
      a clustered request (``feedback_no_silent_failures``).
    * **None** — malformed inputs or invariant violations:
      ``inf_info`` lacks required IF fields, ``resolved_survey.psu`` is
      None, index alignment cannot be verified, or
      ``compute_survey_if_variance`` returned a negative variance. In

):
    """
    Callaway-Sant'Anna (2021) estimator for staggered Difference-in-Differences.

    This estimator handles DiD designs with variation in treatment timing
    (staggered adoption) and heterogeneous treatment effects. It avoids the
    bias of traditional two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimators by:

    1. Computing group-time average treatment effects ATT(g,t) for each
       cohort g (units first treated in period g) and time t.
    2. Aggregating these to summary measures (overall ATT, event study, etc.)
       using appropriate weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    control_group : str, default="never_treated"
        Which units to use as controls:
        - "never_treated": Use only never-treated units (recommended)
        - "not_yet_treated": Use never-treated and not-yet-treated units
    anticipation : int, default=0
        Number of periods before treatment where effects may occur.
        Set to > 0 if treatment effects can begin before the official
        treatment date. Must be a non-negative integer; ``bool`` is
        rejected.
    estimation_method : str, default="dr"
        Estimation method:
        - "dr": Doubly robust (recommended)
        - "ipw": Inverse probability weighting
        - "reg": Outcome regression
    alpha : float, default=0.05
        Significance level for confidence intervals.
    cluster : str, optional
        Column name for cluster-robust standard errors. When set, the
        influence-function aggregator clusters at the named level via a
        synthesized ``SurveyDesign(psu=cluster_col)`` threaded through the
        existing PSU-meat machinery (``_compute_stratified_psu_meat``) and
        PSU-level multiplier bootstrap. When ``None`` (default), the
        aggregator uses per-unit IF variance (Williams 2000 form). When
        ``survey_design=SurveyDesign(psu=...)`` is also provided, the
        explicit PSU takes precedence; a ``UserWarning`` fires if the bare
        ``cluster=`` partition differs from the explicit PSU partition.
    vcov_type : str, default="hc1"
        Variance family. CallawaySantAnna accepts ``{"hc1"}`` only —
        ``hc1`` means per-unit IF variance when ``cluster=None`` and CR1
        Liang-Zeger on the IF when ``cluster=X`` is set. The
        analytical-sandwich families (``classical``, ``hc2``, ``hc2_bm``)
        and spatial-HAC (``conley``) are rejected at ``__init__`` because
        CS's per-(g,t) doubly-robust / IPW / outcome-regression structure
        has no single design matrix to compute hat-matrix leverage or
        Bell-McCaffrey Satterthwaite DOF on. See REGISTRY.md "IF-based
        variance estimators vs analytical-sandwich estimators" for the
        structural taxonomy.
    n_bootstrap : int, default=0
        Number of bootstrap iterations for inference.
        If 0, uses analytical standard errors.
        Recommended: 999 or more for reliable inference.

        .. note:: Memory Usage
            Bootstrap multiplier weights are generated and consumed one
            draw-block at a time (see :mod:`diff_diff.bootstrap_chunking`), so the
            full ``(n_bootstrap, n_units)`` weight matrix is never materialized.
            The live weight intermediate is bounded by roughly
            ``max(~256 MB, 8 * n_units)`` bytes -- a block holds at least one full
            draw row -- independent of ``n_bootstrap``. Only the small bootstrap
            *output* arrays (``(n_bootstrap, n_group_time)`` and ``(n_bootstrap,)``
            per aggregation) stay fully in memory. Stratified survey designs are
            the current exception (the full PSU-weight matrix is built up front,
            but PSUs are few).

    bootstrap_weights : str, default="rademacher"
        Type of weights for multiplier bootstrap:
        - "rademacher": +1/-1 with equal probability (standard choice)
        - "mammen": Two-point distribution (asymptotically valid, matches skewness)
        - "webb": Six-point distribution (recommended when n_clusters < 20)
    seed : int, optional
        Random seed for reproducibility.
    rank_deficient_action : str, default="warn"
        Action when design matrix is rank-deficient (linearly dependent columns):

        - "warn": Issue warning and drop linearly dependent columns (default)
        - "error": Raise ValueError
        - "silent": Drop columns silently without warning
    base_period : str, default="varying"
        Method for selecting the base (reference) period for computing
        ATT(g,t). Base periods are selected *positionally* (by the nearest
        observed period in the sorted panel), matching R ``did::att_gt`` -- so
        on gapped (non-consecutive) grids the base is the nearest observed
        period, not literal ``t-1`` / ``g-1``. The pre/post split is on the
        current period vs the cohort (``t < g`` -> pre), independent of
        anticipation; anticipation only shifts the post/universal base. Options:

        - "varying": pre-treatment (``t < g``) uses the immediately-preceding
          observed period as base; post-treatment uses the last observed
          pre-treatment period (largest observed ``p`` with
          ``p + anticipation < g``).
        - "universal": always uses that last observed pre-treatment period as
          base.

        On consecutive grids these reduce to ``t-1`` / ``g-1-anticipation``.
        Both produce identical post-treatment effects. Matches R's
        ``did::att_gt()`` on gapped panels (base selection, estimable ATT/SE
        cells, the ``"universal"`` zero reference cells, and all aggregations).
        See :func:`_select_base_period`.
    cband : bool, default=True
        Whether to compute simultaneous confidence bands (sup-t) for
        event study aggregation. Requires ``n_bootstrap > 0``.
        When True, results include ``cband_crit_value`` and per-event-time
        ``cband_conf_int`` entries controlling family-wise error rate.
    pscore_trim : float, default=0.01
        Trimming bound for propensity scores. Scores are clipped to
        ``[pscore_trim, 1 - pscore_trim]`` before weight computation
        in IPW and DR estimation. Must be in ``(0, 0.5)`` and large
        enough that ``1 - pscore_trim < 1`` in float64 (a sub-ulp trim
        would disable the upper clip).
    panel : bool, default=True
        Whether the data is a balanced/unbalanced panel (units observed
        across multiple time periods). Set to ``False`` for stationary
        repeated cross-sections where each observation has a unique unit
        ID and units do not repeat across periods. Requires that the
        cross-sectional samples are drawn from the same population in
        each period (stationarity). Uses cross-sectional DRDID
        (Sant'Anna & Zhao 2020, Section 4) with per-observation influence
        functions.
    allow_unbalanced_panel : bool, default=False
        When ``True`` and the input panel is unbalanced (some units are not
        observed in every period), route the pooled observations through the
        repeated-cross-section levels estimator (matching R
        ``did::att_gt(allow_unbalanced_panel=TRUE)`` / ``DRDID::reg_did_rc``)
        instead of within-cell panel differencing, and cluster the influence
        function by unit for the standard error. **Inert on a balanced panel**
        (results are byte-identical to the default). When ``False`` (default)
        an unbalanced panel is handled by within-cell differencing and a
        ``UserWarning`` is emitted. ATT matches R bit-for-bit; the SE matches
        up to the documented CR1 ``sqrt(G/(G-1))`` finite-sample factor.
        ``survey_design=`` combined with this flag raises ``NotImplementedError``.
    epv_threshold : float, default=10
        Events Per Variable threshold for propensity score logit.
        When the ratio of minority-class observations to predictor
        variables (excluding intercept) falls below this value, a
        warning is emitted (or ``ValueError`` raised if
        ``rank_deficient_action="error"``). Based on Peduzzi et al.
        (1996). Only applies to IPW and DR estimation methods.
        Use ``diagnose_propensity()`` for a pre-estimation check across
        all cohorts.
    pscore_fallback : str, default="error"
        Action when propensity score estimation fails entirely
        (``LinAlgError`` or ``ValueError`` from IRLS):

        - "error": Raise the exception (default). Ensures the user is
          aware of estimation failures.
        - "unconditional": Fall back to unconditional propensity
          with a warning. For IPW, this drops all covariates. For DR,
          the propensity model becomes unconditional but outcome
          regression still uses covariates.

        When ``rank_deficient_action="error"``, errors are always
        re-raised regardless of this setting.

    >>> results = cs.fit(data, outcome='outcome', unit='unit',
    ...                  time='time', first_treat='first_treat')
    >>> event_study = results.aggregate('event_study')
    >>> event_study.to_dataframe()  # doctest: +SKIP

    Plotting and the sensitivity analyses (``plot_event_study``,
    ``compute_honest_did``, ``compute_pretrends_power``) still read the
    fit-time surface, so they take a fit that requested aggregation:

    >>> from diff_diff import plot_event_study
    >>> plotted = cs.fit(data, outcome='outcome', unit='unit',
    ...                  time='time', first_treat='first_treat',
    ...                  aggregate='event_study')  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plot_event_study(plotted)  # doctest: +SKIP

    With covariate adjustment (conditional parallel trends):

    >>> # When parallel trends only holds conditional on covariates
    >>> cs = CallawaySantAnna(estimation_method='dr')  # doubly robust
    >>> results = cs.fit(data, outcome='outcome', unit='unit',
    ...                  time='time', first_treat='first_treat',
    ...                  covariates=['age', 'income'])
    >>>
    >>> # DR is recommended: consistent if either outcome model
    >>> # or propensity model is correctly specified

    Notes
    -----
    The key innovation of Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021) is the disaggregated
    approach: instead of estimating a single treatment effect, they estimate
    ATT(g,t) for each cohort-time pair. This avoids the "forbidden comparison"
    problem where already-treated units act as controls.

    The ATT(g,t) is identified under parallel trends conditional on covariates:

        E[Y(0)_t - Y(0)_g-1 | G=g] = E[Y(0)_t - Y(0)_g-1 | C=1]

    where G=g indicates treatment cohort g and C=1 indicates control units.
    This uses g-1 as the base period, which applies to post-treatment (t >= g).
    With base_period="varying" (default), pre-treatment uses the immediately-
    preceding observed period as base for the consecutive comparisons useful in
    parallel trends diagnostics. Base periods are selected positionally (nearest
    observed period), matching R did::att_gt on gapped grids (see
    ``_select_base_period``).

        Check Events Per Variable (EPV) across all cohorts without estimation.

        Examines the data to identify cohorts where propensity score logit may

        et al. (1996).

        This is a raw-count heuristic: it uses total cohort/control unit
        counts without filtering for missing outcomes, zero survey weights,

        -----
        Following R ``compute.att_gt``, the pre/post split is on the current
        period vs the cohort (``t < g`` -> pre), **independent of
        anticipation**; anticipation only enters the post/universal base.
        - ``universal``, or post-treatment (``t >= g``): base is the last
          pre-treatment observed period, i.e. the largest observed ``p`` with
          ``p + anticipation < g``.
        - ``varying`` pre-treatment (``t < g``): base is the immediately
          preceding observed period, i.e. the largest observed ``p < t``.

        Fit the Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : pd.DataFrame
            Panel data with unit and time identifiers. For repeated
            cross-sections (``panel=False``), each observation should
            have a unique unit ID — units do not repeat across periods.
        outcome : str
            Name of outcome variable column.
        unit : str
            Name of unit identifier column.
        time : str
            Name of time period column.
        first_treat : str
            Name of column indicating when unit was first treated.
            Use 0 (or np.inf) for never-treated units.
        covariates : list, optional
            List of covariate column names for conditional parallel trends.
        aggregate : str, optional
            DEPRECATED since 3.9, removed in 4.0 (ledger row M-020). Passing
            it emits a ``FutureWarning``. Aggregate as a post-fit step
            instead - ``results.aggregate("simple" | "event_study" |
            "group")`` - which needs no refit and returns a new object,
            leaving ``results`` unchanged. Accepted values are unchanged:
            - None: Only compute ATT(g,t) (default)
            - "simple": Simple weighted average (overall ATT)
            - "event_study": Aggregate by relative time (event study)
            - "group": Aggregate by treatment cohort
            - "all": Compute all aggregations

            ``compute_honest_did``, ``compute_pretrends_power`` and
            ``plot_event_study`` all accept the post-fit container from
            ``results.aggregate('event_study')`` directly, so no consumer
            requires the fit-time surface anymore. Bootstrapped fits
            (``n_bootstrap > 0``) included: the post-fit RECOMPUTE levels
            (``'event_study'``/``'group'``) REPLAY the fit-time multiplier
            bootstrap from the kit-retained RNG state (percentile
            inference matching a fit-time aggregation to floating-point
            reassociation; ``aggregate('simple')``/``('total')`` still
            relay the stored inference bit-exactly). This parameter
            remains only as the deprecated compatibility path through
            3.9.
        balance_e : int, optional
            DEPRECATED since 3.9, removed in 4.0 (ledger row M-117). Passing
            it emits a ``FutureWarning``; it moves onto the post-fit call as
            ``results.aggregate("event_study", balance_e=...)``. For event
            study, balance the panel at relative time e. Ensures all groups
            contribute to each relative period.
        survey_design : SurveyDesign, optional
            Survey design specification. Supports pweight with strata/PSU/FPC.
            Aggregated SEs (overall, event study, group) use design-based
            variance via compute_survey_if_variance(). All estimation methods
            (reg, ipw, dr) support covariates + survey. For repeated
            cross-sections (``panel=False``), survey weights are
            per-observation (no unit-level collapse).

        Returns
        -------
        CallawaySantAnnaResults
            Object containing all estimation results.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If required columns are missing or data validation fails.

        At the end we convert to the library's pre-scaled phi_i = psi_i / n
        convention where ``se = sqrt(sum(phi^2))``, used by the
        aggregation/bootstrap layer.

        Returns (att, se, inf_func_concat, idx_concat).
