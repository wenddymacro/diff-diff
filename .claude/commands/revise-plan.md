# Revise Plan

Read structured review feedback for a Claude Code plan, display it in the terminal for user consideration, and revise the plan to address the issues — incorporating user overrides and notes.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain:
- **Plan file path** (optional): Path to the plan file, e.g., `~/.claude/plans/foo.md`. If omitted, auto-detected from the most recent `.md` file in `~/.claude/plans/` (excluding `*.review.md` files).
- `--` separator followed by **user notes** (optional): Free-form text with directives about which review items to accept, reject, or modify.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` by splitting on ` -- ` (space-dash-dash-space). Everything before the separator is the plan path (if non-empty after trimming). Everything after is user notes. If `$ARGUMENTS` does not contain ` -- `, the entire argument is treated as the plan path (or empty if `$ARGUMENTS` is empty).

Examples:
- `/revise-plan` — auto-detect plan, accept all review feedback
- `/revise-plan ~/.claude/plans/foo.md` — specific plan, accept all feedback
- `/revise-plan -- Disagree with CRITICAL #2, the API handles this` — auto-detect, with overrides
- `/revise-plan ~/.claude/plans/foo.md -- Skip all LOW items, for MEDIUM #1 use a simpler approach` — specific plan with overrides

## Constraints

- **Plan file only**: Only modifies the plan file. Does NOT create, edit, or delete any project source code, tests, or documentation.
- **Works outside plan mode**: This skill is invoked from a normal (non-plan-mode) conversation. It enters plan mode via `EnterPlanMode` for the revision step.
- **Terminal-first**: The review content is always displayed in the terminal for the user to read before any revision begins.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Locate Plan File

Determine the plan file path:

1. **From arguments**: If a path was provided before ` -- `, use it.
2. **From most recent plan**: If no path provided, find the most recent plan:
   ```bash
   ls -t ~/.claude/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v '\.review\.md$' | head -1
   ```
3. **Ask user**: If no plan file found, use AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   Which plan file would you like to revise?
   Enter the path (e.g., ~/.claude/plans/plan-name.md)
   ```

Verify the plan file exists by reading it. If it doesn't exist, report the error and stop.

### Step 2: Locate and Read Review File

Derive the review file path: extract the plan file's basename, replace the trailing `.md` with `.review.md`, and look in `~/.claude/plans/`. For example, `~/.claude/plans/foo.md` → `~/.claude/plans/foo.review.md`.

**If the review file exists**: Read it, proceed to Step 3.

**If the review file does not exist**: Use AskUserQuestion:
- "Run a review now (spawns a review agent)" (Recommended)
- "Skip review and enter plan mode directly"

If "Run a review now" is chosen:
- Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`. Prompt the agent:
  ```
  You are reviewing a Claude Code plan file as an independent reviewer.

  1. Read the review criteria from `.claude/commands/review-plan.md` (Steps 2 through 5)
  2. Read the plan file at: <plan-path>
  3. Follow the review instructions: read CLAUDE.md for project context, read referenced files, evaluate across 8 dimensions, present structured feedback
  4. Number each issue sequentially within its severity section (CRITICAL #1, MEDIUM #1, etc.)
  5. Return the COMPLETE structured review output (from "## Overall Assessment" through "## Summary")
  ```
- Save the agent's output to the review file path with YAML frontmatter (see `.claude/commands/review-plan.md` Step 6 for format)
- Write the plan path to `~/.claude/plans/.last-reviewed`
- Proceed to Step 3 with the review content

If "Skip review" is chosen:
- Skip Steps 3-5 (no review to display, check, or parse)
- In Step 6, since there are no review issues, present only:
  - "Enter plan mode with general guidance" (Recommended)
  - "Cancel"
  If "Cancel" is chosen, stop and report "Revision cancelled."
- In Step 7, since there are no review issues to address:
  - Skip rule-based revision (no CRITICAL/MEDIUM/LOW to process)
  - Apply user notes as general guidance for the revision
  - Ensure the plans directory exists: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/plans`
  - Write a minimal "Skipped" review marker to `~/.claude/plans/<plan-basename>.review.md` (the centralized review path from Change 3) before calling `ExitPlanMode` to satisfy the hook:
    ```yaml
    ---
    plan: <plan-file-path>
    reviewed_at: <ISO 8601 timestamp>
    verdict: "Skipped"
    critical_count: 0
    medium_count: 0
    low_count: 0
    flags: []
    ---
    Review skipped by user.
    ```
  - Write the plan path to `~/.claude/plans/.last-reviewed` (same as the review-present path in Step 2)
  - In `## Revision Notes`, record: "Review skipped — revision based on user notes only"
  - All issue counts are zero in the Addressed/Dismissed/Open sections
  - If the review marker write fails, report an error and stop — the hook requires this file on disk.

### Step 3: Display Plan and Review in Terminal

Display both the plan content and the review in the conversation. The plan was already read in Step 1, and the review in Step 2. This is the primary reading surface — the user reads both here.

```
## Plan: <plan-filename>

<full plan content>

---

## Review for <plan-filename>

<full review content (excluding YAML frontmatter)>

---
Source: <review-file-path>
```

### Step 4: Staleness Check

Compare file modification times. The review file is always in `~/.claude/plans/`:
```bash
PLAN_PATH="<plan-path>"
REVIEW_PATH="$HOME/.claude/plans/$(basename "$PLAN_PATH" .md).review.md"
[ "$PLAN_PATH" -nt "$REVIEW_PATH" ] && echo "STALE" || echo "FRESH"
```

If the plan is newer than the review, warn:
```
Warning: The plan file was modified after this review was generated.
The review may be commenting on an older version of the plan.
Consider running `/review-plan <plan-path> --updated` for a fresh review.
```

### Step 5: Parse and Summarize Review

Extract from the review content:
- Issues by severity: CRITICAL #N, MEDIUM #N, LOW #N
- Checklist gaps
- Questions for Author
- Verdict

Display a summary:
```
Found: N CRITICAL, N MEDIUM, N LOW issues, N checklist gaps, N questions
Verdict: <verdict>
```

### Step 6: Collect User Input

If user notes were provided in `$ARGUMENTS` (after ` -- `), parse them for directives:
- "disagree with #N" or "dismiss #N" → mark that issue as dismissed
- "skip #N" → mark as dismissed
- "skip all LOW" → dismiss all LOW severity issues
- "for #N, do X instead" → override the suggested fix
- "address all" or no specific directives → accept all feedback
- Free-form text applies as general guidance

If no user notes were provided, use AskUserQuestion:
- "Address all issues" (Recommended)
- "Let me specify which items to address or dismiss"

If "Let me specify" is chosen, the user provides free-form text. Parse as above.

### Step 7: Enter Plan Mode and Revise

Call `EnterPlanMode` to transition into plan mode. In plan mode:

1. **Read the current plan file** in full
2. **Read source files** referenced in CRITICAL/MEDIUM issues and files the plan proposes to modify
3. **Revise the plan** following these rules:
   - **CRITICAL issues**: Address unless user explicitly dismissed with justification
   - **MEDIUM issues**: Address unless user dismissed
   - **LOW issues**: Skip unless user explicitly requested them
   - **Questions for Author**: Incorporate user's answers if provided; otherwise note as "Open — to be resolved during implementation"
   - **Checklist gaps**: Add missing items as plan steps where appropriate
4. **Append a `## Revision Notes` section** at the end of the plan:
   ```markdown
   ## Revision Notes

   Revised based on review at <review-file-path>.

   ### Addressed
   - CRITICAL #1: <brief description of what was changed>
   - MEDIUM #2: <brief description>

   ### Dismissed
   - MEDIUM #3: <reason — user's justification or "user override">

   ### Open
   - Question #1: <question text — to be resolved during implementation>
   ```
5. **Write the revised plan** using the Edit or Write tool
6. **Touch the review file** to update its mtime so the hook's staleness check passes after an intentional revision:
   ```bash
   touch ~/.claude/plans/<plan-basename>.review.md
   ```
7. **Call `ExitPlanMode`** for user approval

### Step 8: Report

After exiting plan mode, summarize:
```
Plan revised: <plan-path>
- Addressed: N issues
- Dismissed: N issues
- Open: N items

To re-review the revised plan:
  /review-plan <plan-path> --updated
```

## Notes

- This skill works outside plan mode and transitions into plan mode for the revision
- The review is always displayed in the terminal for the user to read before any revision begins
- If no review file exists, a review agent can be spawned automatically — no second window needed
- User notes/overrides take priority over review recommendations
- Only the plan file is modified; no project source code is touched
- The `## Revision Notes` section provides an audit trail of what was addressed and why
- Pairs with `/review-plan` for iterative revision: `/review-plan` generates feedback, `/revise-plan` addresses it
- For subsequent rounds, run `/review-plan <path> --updated` to get a delta assessment of improvements
