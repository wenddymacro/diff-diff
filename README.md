A Python library for Difference-in-Differences (DiD) causal inference - sklearn-like estimators with statsmodels-style outputs, built for econometricians, marketing analysts, and data scientists running campaign-lift, policy, and staggered-rollout analyses.

## Installation

```bash
pip install diff-diff
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igerber/diff-diff.git
cd diff-diff
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd
from diff_diff import DifferenceInDifferences  # or: DiD

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'outcome': [10, 11, 15, 18, 9, 10, 12, 13],
    'treated': [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    'post': [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
})

did = DifferenceInDifferences()
results = did.fit(data, outcome='outcome', treatment='treated', post='post')
print(results)              # DiDResults(ATT=3.0000, SE=1.7321, p=0.1583)
results.print_summary()     # full statsmodels-style table
```

## For AI Agents

If you are an AI agent or LLM using this library, call `diff_diff.get_llm_guide()` for a concise API reference with an 8-step practitioner workflow (based on Baker et al. 2026). The workflow ensures rigorous DiD analysis - testing assumptions, running sensitivity analysis, and checking robustness, not just calling `fit()`.

```python
from diff_diff import get_llm_guide

get_llm_guide()                 # concise API reference
get_llm_guide("practitioner")   # 8-step workflow (Baker et al. 2026)
get_llm_guide("full")           # comprehensive documentation
get_llm_guide("autonomous")     # autonomous-agent variant
```

The guides are bundled in the wheel - accessible from a `pip install` with no network access. After estimation, call `practitioner_next_steps(results)` for context-aware guidance on remaining diagnostic steps.

## For Data Scientists

Measuring campaign lift? Evaluating a product launch? Rolling out a policy in waves? diff-diff handles the causal inference so you can focus on the business question.

- [Which method fits my problem?](https://diff-diff.readthedocs.io/en/stable/practitioner_decision_tree.html) - start from your business scenario (campaign in some markets, staggered rollout, survey data) and find the right estimator
- [Getting started for practitioners](https://diff-diff.readthedocs.io/en/stable/practitioner_getting_started.html) - end-to-end walkthrough from marketing campaign to causal estimate to stakeholder-ready result
- [Brand awareness survey tutorial](https://diff-diff.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/17_brand_awareness_survey.html) - full example with complex survey design, brand funnel analysis, and staggered rollouts
- Have BRFSS/ACS/CPS individual records? Use [`aggregate_survey()`](https://diff-diff.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/prep.html) to roll respondent-level microdata into a geographic-period panel with inverse-variance precision weights for second-stage DiD

`BusinessReport` and `DiagnosticReport` are experimental preview classes that produce plain-English output and a structured `to_dict()` schema from any fitted result - wording and schema will evolve. See [docs/methodology/REPORTING.md](https://github.com/igerber/diff-diff/blob/main/docs/methodology/REPORTING.md) for usage and stability notes.

## Practitioner Workflow (Baker et al. 2026)

For rigorous DiD analysis, follow these 8 steps. Skipping diagnostic steps produces unreliable results.

1. **Define target parameter** - ATT, group-time ATT(g,t), or event-study ATT_es(e). State whether weighted or unweighted.
2. **State identification assumptions** - which parallel trends variant (unconditional, conditional, PT-GT-Nev, PT-GT-NYT), no-anticipation, overlap.
3. **Test parallel trends** - simple 2x2: `check_parallel_trends()`, `equivalence_test_trends()`; staggered: inspect CS event-study pre-period coefficients (generic PT tests are invalid for staggered designs). Insignificant pre-trends do NOT prove PT holds.
4. **Choose estimator** - staggered adoption -> CS/SA/BJS (NOT plain TWFE); few treated units -> SDiD; factor confounding -> TROP; simple 2x2 -> DiD. Run `BaconDecomposition` to diagnose TWFE bias.
5. **Estimate** - `estimator.fit(data, ...)`. Always print the cluster count first and choose inference method based on the result (cluster-robust if >= 50 clusters, wild bootstrap if fewer - for DifferenceInDifferences pass `cluster=`; TwoWayFixedEffects auto-clusters at unit level).
6. **Sensitivity analysis** - `compute_honest_did(results)` for bounds under PT violations (MultiPeriodDiD, CS, or dCDH natively; the TwoWayFixedEffects `event_study=True` surface and a StackedDiD `results.aggregate('event_study')` container also admit - Stacked needs `kappa_pre >= 2`), `run_all_placebo_tests()` for 2x2 falsification, specification comparisons for staggered designs.
7. **Heterogeneity** - CS: `results.aggregate('group')`/`'event_study'` (post-fit, no refit); SA: `results.event_study_effects` / `to_dataframe(level='cohort')`; Stacked: `results.aggregate('event_study')`/`'simple'` post-fit views (surface always computed since 3.9); EDiD: `results.aggregate(...)` post-fit from retained EIFs (3.9); ImputationDiD/TwoStageDiD: `results.aggregate(...)` post-fit from panel-backed kits (3.9); ContinuousDiD: `results.aggregate('dose'/'simple'/'event_study')` post-fit (3.9; dose/simple are views, event_study recomputes); subgroup re-estimation.
8. **Robustness** - compare 2-3 estimators (CS vs SA vs BJS), report with and without covariates (shows whether conditioning drives identification), present pre-trends and sensitivity bounds.

## Survey Support

Most estimators accept an optional `survey_design` parameter (or `survey=` / `weights=` for `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD`) for design-based variance estimation. Coverage and supported weight types vary by estimator - see the [Survey Design Support compatibility matrix](https://diff-diff.readthedocs.io/en/stable/choosing_estimator.html#survey-design-support) for the per-estimator support table.

- **Design elements available across the supported set**: strata, PSU, FPC, lonely PSU handling, nest. Weight types vary by estimator: some surfaces (e.g. CallawaySantAnna, StackedDiD, the HAD continuous path) accept `pweight` only; others accept `pweight` / `fweight` / `aweight`.
- **Variance methods**: Taylor Series Linearization (TSL via Binder 1983), replicate weights (BRR / Fay / JK1 / JKn / SDR), survey-aware bootstrap
- **Diagnostics**: DEFF per coefficient, effective n, subpopulation analysis, weight trimming, CV on estimates
- **Repeated cross-sections**: `CallawaySantAnna(panel=False)` for BRFSS, ACS, CPS
- **Weight calibration / raking**: upstream by design - pair with Meta's [balance](https://import-balance.org/) package, whose `balance.interop.diff_diff` adapter hands raked samples straight to diff-diff; see the [composition-drift tutorial](https://diff-diff.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/26_composition_drift_calibration.html)

No other Python or R DiD package offers design-based variance estimation for modern heterogeneity-robust estimators.
