diff-diff: Difference-in-Differences in Python
==============================================

**diff-diff** is a Python library for Difference-in-Differences (DiD) causal inference analysis.
It provides sklearn-like estimators with statsmodels-style output for econometric analysis.

.. code-block:: python

   from diff_diff import DifferenceInDifferences, generate_did_data

   # Simulate a panel: 100 units, 10 periods, true treatment lift of 5.0
   data = generate_did_data(
       n_units=100,
       n_periods=10,
       treatment_effect=5.0,
       treatment_period=5,
       treatment_fraction=0.5,
       seed=42,
   )

   # Fit a basic DiD model
   did = DifferenceInDifferences()
   results = did.fit(data, outcome='outcome', treatment='treated', post='post')
   print(results.summary())

What is Difference-in-Differences?
----------------------------------

Difference-in-Differences (DiD) is a quasi-experimental research design that estimates
causal treatment effects by comparing outcome changes over time between treated and
control groups. It is one of the most widely used methods in applied economics,
public policy evaluation, and social science research.

Why diff-diff?
--------------

- **Complete method coverage**: 20+ estimators from basic 2x2 DiD to cutting-edge methods like Efficient DiD (Chen et al. 2025), TROP (Athey et al. 2025), and HAD (de Chaisemartin et al. 2026)
- **Familiar API**: sklearn-like ``fit()`` interface — if you know scikit-learn, you know diff-diff
- **Modern staggered methods**: Callaway-Sant'Anna, Sun-Abraham, Imputation DiD, Two-Stage DiD, and Stacked DiD handle heterogeneous treatment timing correctly
- **Robust inference**: Heteroskedasticity-robust, cluster-robust, wild cluster bootstrap, and multiplier bootstrap
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Honest DiD (Rambachan & Roth 2023) for robust inference under parallel trends violations
- **Validated against R**: Benchmarked against ``did``, ``synthdid``, and ``fixest`` — see :doc:`benchmarks`
- **No heavy dependencies**: Only numpy, pandas, and scipy
