# Core DiD Estimators

## DifferenceInDifferences

**Primary source:** Canonical econometrics textbooks
- Wooldridge, J.M. (2010). *Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data*, 2nd ed. MIT Press.
- Angrist, J.D., & Pischke, J.-S. (2009). *Mostly Harmless Econometrics*. Princeton University Press.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Treatment and post indicators must be binary (0/1) with variation in both
- Warns if no treated units in pre-period or no control units in post-period
- Parallel trends assumption is untestable but can be assessed with pre-treatment data

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*
```
ATT = (Ȳ_{treated,post} - Ȳ_{treated,pre}) - (Ȳ_{control,post} - Ȳ_{control,pre})
    = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | D=1]
```

Regression form:
```
Y_it = α + β₁(Treated_i) + β₂(Post_t) + τ(Treated_i × Post_t) + X'γ + ε_it
```
where τ is the ATT.

*Standard errors:*
- Default: HC1 heteroskedasticity-robust
- Optional: Cluster-robust (specify `cluster` parameter)
- Optional: Wild cluster bootstrap for small number of clusters

*Edge cases:*
- Empty cells (e.g., no treated-pre observations) cause rank deficiency, handled per `rank_deficient_action` setting
  - With "warn" (default): emits warning, sets NaN for affected coefficients
  - With "error": raises ValueError
  - With "silent": continues silently with NaN coefficients
- Singleton clusters (one observation): included in variance estimation; contribute to meat matrix via u_i² X_i X_i' (same formula as larger clusters with n_g=1)
- Rank-deficient design matrix (collinearity): warns and sets NA for dropped coefficients (R-style, matches `lm()`)
  - Tolerance: `1e-07` (matches R's `qr()` default), relative to largest diagonal element of R in QR decomposition
  - Controllable via `rank_deficient_action` parameter: "warn" (default), "error", or "silent"

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `fixest::feols()` with interaction term
- Stata: `reghdfe` or manual regression with interaction

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Treatment and time indicators are binary 0/1 with variation
- [x] ATT equals coefficient on interaction term
- [x] Wild bootstrap supports Rademacher, Mammen, Webb weight distributions
- [x] Formula interface parses `y ~ treated * post` correctly

**Primary source:** Event study methodology
- Freyaldenhoven, S., Hansen, C., Pérez, J.P., & Shapiro, J.M. (2021). Visualization, identification, and estimation in the linear panel event-study design. NBER Working Paper 29170.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires multiple pre and post periods
- Reference period (typically t=-1) must be specified or defaulted
- Warns if treatment timing varies across units (suggests staggered estimator)

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*
```
Y_it = α_i + γ_t + Σ_{e≠-1} δ_e × 1(t - E_i = e) + X'β + ε_it
```
where E_i is treatment time for unit i, and δ_e are event-study coefficients.

*Standard errors:*
- Default: Cluster-robust at unit level
- Event-study coefficients use appropriate degrees of freedom

*Edge cases:*
- Unbalanced panels: only uses observations where event-time is defined
- Never-treated units: event-time indicators are all zero
- Endpoint binning: distant event times can be binned
- Rank-deficient design matrix (collinearity): warns and sets NA for dropped coefficients (R-style, matches `lm()`)
- Average ATT (`avg_att`) is NA if any post-period effect is unidentified (R-style NA propagation)

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `fixest::feols()` with `i(event_time, ref=-1)`
- Stata: `eventdd` or manual indicator regression

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] Reference period coefficient is zero (normalized)
- [ ] Pre-period coefficients test parallel trends assumption
- [ ] Supports both balanced and unbalanced panels
- [ ] Returns PeriodEffect objects with confidence intervals

## TwoWayFixedEffects

**Primary source:** Panel data econometrics
- Wooldridge, J.M. (2010). *Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data*, 2nd ed. MIT Press, Chapter 10.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- **Staggered treatment warning**: If treatment timing varies across units, warns about potential bias from negative weights (Goodman-Bacon 2021, de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfœuille 2020)
- Requires sufficient within-unit and within-time variation
- Warns if any fixed effect is perfectly collinear with treatment

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*
```
Y_it = α_i + γ_t + τ(D_it) + X'β + ε_it
```
Estimated via within-transformation (demeaning):
```
Ỹ_it = τD̃_it + X̃'β + ε̃_it
```
where tildes denote demeaned variables.

*Standard errors:*
- Default: Cluster-robust at unit level (accounts for serial correlation)
- Degrees of freedom adjusted for absorbed fixed effects

*Edge cases:*
- Singleton units/periods are automatically dropped
- Treatment perfectly collinear with FE raises error with informative message listing dropped columns
- Covariate collinearity emits warning but estimation continues (ATT still identified)
- Rank-deficient design matrix: warns and sets NA for dropped coefficients (R-style, matches `lm()`)
- Unbalanced panels handled via proper demeaning

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `fixest::feols(y ~ treat | unit + time, data)`
- Stata: `reghdfe y treat, absorb(unit time) cluster(unit)`

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] Staggered treatment automatically triggers warning
- [ ] Auto-clusters standard errors at unit level
- [ ] `decompose()` method returns BaconDecompositionResults
- [ ] Within-transformation correctly handles unbalanced panels

# Modern Staggered Estimators

## CallawaySantAnna

**Primary source:** [Callaway, B., & Sant'Anna, P.H.C. (2021). Difference-in-Differences with multiple time periods. *Journal of Econometrics*, 225(2), 200-230.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.001)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires never-treated units as comparison group (identified by `first_treat=0` or `never_treated=True`)
- Warns if no never-treated units exist (suggests alternative comparison strategies)
- Limited pre-treatment periods reduce ability to test parallel trends

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

Group-time average treatment effect:
```
ATT(g,t) = E[Y_t - Y_{g-1} | G_g=1] - E[Y_t - Y_{g-1} | C=1]
```
where G_g=1 indicates units first treated in period g, and C=1 indicates never-treated.

*Note:* This equation uses g-1 as the base period, which applies to post-treatment effects (t ≥ g) and `base_period="universal"`. With `base_period="varying"` (default), pre-treatment effects use t-1 as base for consecutive comparisons (see Base period selection in Edge cases).

With covariates (doubly robust):
```
ATT(g,t) = E[((G_g - p̂_g(X))/(1-p̂_g(X))) × (Y_t - Y_{g-1} - m̂_{0,g,t}(X) + m̂_{0,g,g-1}(X))] / E[G_g]
```

Aggregations:
- Simple: `ATT = Σ_{g,t} w_{g,t} × ATT(g,t)` weighted by group size
- Event-study: `ATT(e) = Σ_g w_g × ATT(g, g+e)` for event-time e
- Group: `ATT(g) = Σ_t ATT(g,t) / T_g` average over post-periods

*Standard errors:*
- Default: Analytical (influence function-based)
- Bootstrap: Multiplier bootstrap with Rademacher, Mammen, or Webb weights
- Block structure preserves within-unit correlation

*Bootstrap weight distributions:*

The multiplier bootstrap uses random weights w_i with E[w]=0 and Var(w)=1:

| Weight Type | Values | Probabilities | Properties |
|-------------|--------|---------------|------------|
| Rademacher | ±1 | 1/2 each | Simplest; E[w³]=0 |
| Mammen | -(√5-1)/2, (√5+1)/2 | (√5+1)/(2√5), (√5-1)/(2√5) | E[w³]=1; better for skewed data |
| Webb | ±√(3/2), ±1, ±√(1/2) | 1/6 each | 6-point; recommended for few clusters |

**Webb distribution details:**
- Values: {-√(3/2), -1, -√(1/2), √(1/2), 1, √(3/2)} ≈ {-1.225, -1, -0.707, 0.707, 1, 1.225}
- Equal probabilities (1/6 each) giving E[w]=0, Var(w)=1
- Matches R's `did` package implementation
- **Verification**: Implementation matches `fwildclusterboot` R package
  ([C++ source](https://github.com/s3alfisc/fwildclusterboot/blob/master/src/wildboottest.cpp))
  which uses identical `sqrt(1.5)`, `1`, `sqrt(0.5)` values with equal 1/6 probabilities.
  Some documentation shows simplified values (±1.5, ±1, ±0.5) but actual implementations
  use square root values to achieve unit variance.
- Reference: Webb, M.D. (2023). Reworking Wild Bootstrap Based Inference for Clustered Errors.
  Queen's Economics Department Working Paper No. 1315. (Updated from Webb 2014)

*Edge cases:*
- Groups with single observation: included but may have high variance
- Missing group-time cells: ATT(g,t) set to NaN
- Anticipation: `anticipation` parameter shifts reference period
  - Group aggregation includes periods t >= g - anticipation (not just t >= g)
  - Both analytical SE and bootstrap SE aggregation respect anticipation
- Rank-deficient design matrix (covariate collinearity):
  - Detection: Pivoted QR decomposition with tolerance `1e-07` (R's `qr()` default)
  - Handling: Warns and drops linearly dependent columns, sets NA for dropped coefficients (R-style, matches `lm()`)
  - Parameter: `rank_deficient_action` controls behavior: "warn" (default), "error", or "silent"
- Non-finite inference values:
  - Analytic SE: Returns NaN to signal invalid inference (not biased via zeroing)
  - Bootstrap: Drops non-finite samples, warns, and adjusts p-value floor accordingly
  - Threshold: Returns NaN if <50% of bootstrap samples are valid
  - Per-effect t_stat: Uses NaN (not 0.0) when SE is non-finite or zero (consistent with overall_t_stat)
  - **Note**: This is a defensive enhancement over reference implementations (R's `did::att_gt`, Stata's `csdid`) which may error or produce unhandled inf/nan in edge cases without informative warnings
- No post-treatment effects (all treatment occurs after data ends):
  - Overall ATT set to NaN (no post-treatment periods to aggregate)
  - All overall inference fields (SE, t-stat, p-value, CI) also set to NaN
  - Warning emitted: "No post-treatment effects for aggregation"
  - Individual pre-treatment ATT(g,t) are computed (for parallel trends assessment)
  - Bootstrap runs for per-effect SEs even without post-treatment; only overall statistics are NaN
  - **Principle**: NaN propagates consistently through overall inference fields; pre-treatment effects get full bootstrap inference
- Aggregated t_stat (event-study, group-level):
  - Uses NaN when SE is non-finite or zero (matches per-effect and overall t_stat behavior)
  - Previous behavior (0.0 default) was inconsistent and misleading
- Base period selection (`base_period` parameter):
  - "varying" (default): Pre-treatment uses t-1 as base (consecutive comparisons)
  - "universal": All comparisons use g-anticipation-1 as base
  - Both produce identical post-treatment ATT(g,t); differ only pre-treatment
  - Matches R `did::att_gt()` base_period parameter
  - **Event study output**: With "universal", includes reference period (e=-1-anticipation)
    with effect=0, se=NaN, conf_int=(NaN, NaN). Inference fields are NaN since this is
    a normalization constraint, not an estimated effect. Only added when real effects exist.
- Base period interaction with Sun-Abraham comparison:
  - CS with `base_period="varying"` produces different pre-treatment estimates than SA
  - This is expected: CS uses consecutive comparisons, SA uses fixed reference (e=-1-anticipation)
  - Use `base_period="universal"` for methodologically comparable pre-treatment effects
  - Post-treatment effects match regardless of base_period setting
- Control group with `control_group="not_yet_treated"`:
  - Always excludes cohort g from controls when computing ATT(g,t)
  - This applies to both pre-treatment (t < g) and post-treatment (t >= g) periods
  - For pre-treatment periods: even though cohort g hasn't been treated yet at time t, they are the treated group for this ATT(g,t) and cannot serve as their own controls
  - Control mask: `never_treated OR (first_treat > t AND first_treat != g)`

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `did::att_gt()` (Callaway & Sant'Anna's official package)
- Stata: `csdid`

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] Requires never-treated units (first_treat=0 or equivalent)
- [ ] Bootstrap weights support Rademacher, Mammen, Webb distributions
- [ ] Aggregations: simple, event_study, group all implemented
- [ ] Doubly robust estimation when covariates provided
- [ ] Multiplier bootstrap preserves panel structure

## SunAbraham

**Primary source:** [Sun, L., & Abraham, S. (2021). Estimating dynamic treatment effects in event studies with heterogeneous treatment effects. *Journal of Econometrics*, 225(2), 175-199.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.006)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires never-treated units as control group
- Warns if treatment effects may be heterogeneous across cohorts (which the method handles)
- Reference period: e=-1-anticipation (defaults to e=-1 when anticipation=0)

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

Saturated regression with cohort-specific effects:
```
Y_it = α_i + γ_t + Σ_{g∈G} Σ_{e≠-1} δ_{g,e} × 1(G_i=g) × D^e_{it} + ε_it
```
where G_i is unit i's cohort (first treatment period), D^e_{it} = 1(t - G_i = e).

Interaction-weighted estimator:
```
δ̂_e = Σ_g ŵ_{g,e} × δ̂_{g,e}
```
where weights ŵ_{g,e} = n_{g,e} / Σ_g n_{g,e} (sample share of cohort g at event-time e).

*Standard errors:*
- Default: Cluster-robust at unit level
- Delta method for aggregated coefficients
- Optional: Pairs bootstrap for robustness

*Edge cases:*
- Single cohort: reduces to standard event study
- Cohorts with no observations at some event-times: weighted appropriately
- Extrapolation beyond observed event-times: not estimated
- Rank-deficient design matrix (covariate collinearity):
  - Detection: Pivoted QR decomposition with tolerance `1e-07` (R's `qr()` default)
  - Handling: Warns and drops linearly dependent columns, sets NA for dropped coefficients (R-style, matches `lm()`)
  - Parameter: `rank_deficient_action` controls behavior: "warn" (default), "error", or "silent"
- NaN inference for undefined statistics:
  - t_stat: Uses NaN (not 0.0) when SE is non-finite or zero
  - Analytical inference: p_value and CI also NaN when t_stat is NaN (NaN propagates through `compute_p_value` and `compute_confidence_interval`)
  - Bootstrap inference: p_value and CI computed from bootstrap distribution, may be valid even when SE/t_stat is NaN (only NaN if <50% of bootstrap samples are valid)
  - Applies to overall ATT, per-effect event study, and aggregated event study
  - **Note**: Defensive enhancement matching CallawaySantAnna behavior; R's `fixest::sunab()` may produce Inf/NaN without warning

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `fixest::sunab()` (Laurent Bergé's implementation)
- Stata: `eventstudyinteract`

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] Never-treated units required as controls
- [ ] Interaction weights sum to 1 within each relative time period
- [ ] Reference period defaults to e=-1, coefficient normalized to zero
- [ ] Cohort-specific effects recoverable from results
- [ ] Cluster-robust SEs with delta method for aggregates

# Advanced Estimators

## SyntheticDiD

**Primary source:** [Arkhangelsky, D., Athey, S., Hirshberg, D.A., Imbens, G.W., & Wager, S. (2021). Synthetic Difference-in-Differences. *American Economic Review*, 111(12), 4088-4118.](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20190159)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires balanced panel (same units observed in all periods)
- Warns if pre-treatment fit is poor (high RMSE)
- Treatment must be "block" structure: all treated units treated at same time

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

```
τ̂^sdid = Σ_t λ_t (Ȳ_{tr,t} - Σ_j ω_j Y_{j,t})
```

Unit weights ω solve:
```
min_ω ||Ȳ_{tr,pre} - Σ_j ω_j Y_{j,pre}||₂² + ζ² ||ω||₂²
s.t. ω ≥ 0, Σ_j ω_j = 1
```

Time weights λ solve analogous problem matching pre/post means.

Regularization parameter:
```
ζ = (N_tr × T_post)^(1/4) × σ̂
```
where σ̂ is estimated noise level.

*Standard errors:*
- Default: Placebo variance estimator (Algorithm 4 in paper)
```
V̂ = ((r-1)/r) × Var({τ̂^(j) : j ∈ controls})
```
where τ̂^(j) is placebo estimate treating unit j as treated
- Alternative: Block bootstrap

*Edge cases:*
- Negative weights attempted: projected onto simplex
- Perfect pre-treatment fit: regularization prevents overfitting
- Single treated unit: valid, uses jackknife-style variance

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `synthdid::synthdid_estimate()` (Arkhangelsky et al.'s official package)

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] Unit weights: sum to 1, non-negative (simplex constraint)
- [ ] Time weights: sum to 1, non-negative (simplex constraint)
- [ ] Placebo SE formula: `sqrt((r-1)/r) * sd(placebo_estimates)`
- [ ] Regularization scales with panel dimensions
- [ ] Returns both unit and time weights for interpretation

## TripleDifference

**Primary source:** [Ortiz-Villavicencio, M., & Sant'Anna, P.H.C. (2025). Better Understanding Triple Differences Estimators. arXiv:2505.09942.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09942)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires all 8 cells of the 2×2×2 design: Group(0/1) × Period(0/1) × Treatment(0/1)
- Warns if any cell has fewer than threshold observations
- Propensity score overlap required for IPW/DR methods

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

Eight-cell structure:
```
τ^DDD = [(Ȳ₁₁₁ - Ȳ₁₀₁) - (Ȳ₀₁₁ - Ȳ₀₀₁)] - [(Ȳ₁₁₀ - Ȳ₁₀₀) - (Ȳ₀₁₀ - Ȳ₀₀₀)]
```
where subscripts are (Group, Period, Treatment eligibility).

Regression form:
```
Y = β₀ + β_G(G) + β_P(P) + β_T(T) + β_{GP}(G×P) + β_{GT}(G×T) + β_{PT}(P×T) + τ(G×P×T) + X'γ + ε
```

Doubly robust estimator:
```
τ̂^DR = E[(ψ_IPW(Y,D,X;π̂) + ψ_RA(Y,X;μ̂) - ψ_bias(X;π̂,μ̂))]
```

*Standard errors:*
- Regression adjustment: HC1 or cluster-robust
- IPW: Influence function-based (accounts for estimated propensity)
- Doubly robust: Efficient influence function

*Edge cases:*
- Propensity scores near 0/1: trimmed at `pscore_trim` (default 0.01)
- Empty cells: raises ValueError with diagnostic message
- Collinear covariates: automatic detection and warning
- NaN inference for undefined statistics:
  - t_stat: Uses NaN (not 0.0) when SE is non-finite or zero
  - p_value and CI: Also NaN when t_stat is NaN
  - **Note**: Defensive enhancement; reference implementation behavior not yet documented

**Reference implementation(s):**
- Authors' replication code (forthcoming)

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] All 8 cells (G×P×T) must have observations
- [ ] Propensity scores clipped at `pscore_trim` bounds
- [ ] Doubly robust consistent if either propensity or outcome model correct
- [ ] Returns cell means for diagnostic inspection
- [ ] Supports RA, IPW, and DR estimation methods

## TROP

**Primary source:** [Athey, S., Imbens, G.W., Qu, Z., & Viviano, D. (2025). Triply Robust Panel Estimators. arXiv:2508.21536.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21536)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires sufficient pre-treatment periods for factor estimation (at least 2)
- Warns if estimated rank seems too high/low relative to panel dimensions
- Unit weights can become degenerate if λ_unit too large
- Returns Q(λ) = ∞ if ANY LOOCV fit fails (Equation 5 compliance)

*Treatment indicator (D matrix) semantics:*

D must be an **ABSORBING STATE** indicator, not a treatment timing indicator:
- D[t, i] = 0 for all t < g_i (pre-treatment periods for unit i)
- D[t, i] = 1 for all t >= g_i (during and after treatment for unit i)

where g_i is the treatment start time for unit i.

For staggered adoption, different units have different treatment start times g_i.
The D matrix naturally handles this - distances use periods where BOTH units
have D=0, matching the paper's (1 - W_iu)(1 - W_ju) formula in Equation 3.

**Wrong D specification**: If user provides event-style D (only first treatment period
has D=1), ATT will be incorrect - document this clearly.

*ATT definition (Equation 1, Section 6.1):*
```
τ̂ = (1 / Σ_i Σ_t W_{it}) Σ_{i=1}^N Σ_{t=1}^T W_{it} τ̂_{it}(λ̂)
```
- ATT averages over ALL cells where D_it=1 (treatment indicator)
- No separate "post_periods" concept - D matrix is the sole input for treatment timing
- Supports general assignment patterns including staggered adoption

*Estimator equation (as implemented, Section 2.2):*

Working model (separating unit/time FE from regularized factor component):
```
Y_it(0) = α_i + β_t + L_it + ε_it,   E[ε_it | L] = 0
```
where α_i are unit fixed effects, β_t are time fixed effects, and L = UΣV' is a low-rank
factor structure. The FE are estimated separately from L because L is regularized but
the fixed effects are not.

Optimization (Equation 2):
```
(α̂, β̂, L̂) = argmin_{α,β,L} Σ_j Σ_s θ_s^{i,t} ω_j^{i,t} (1-W_js)(Y_js - α_j - β_s - L_js)² + λ_nn ||L||_*
```
Solved via alternating minimization with soft-thresholding of singular values for L:
```
L̂ = U × soft_threshold(Σ, λ_nn) × V'
```

Per-observation weights (Equation 3):
```
θ_s^{i,t}(λ) = exp(-λ_time × |t - s|)

ω_j^{i,t}(λ) = exp(-λ_unit × dist^unit_{-t}(j, i))

dist^unit_{-t}(j, i) = (Σ_u 1{u≠t}(1-W_iu)(1-W_ju)(Y_iu - Y_ju)² / Σ_u 1{u≠t}(1-W_iu)(1-W_ju))^{1/2}
```
Note: weights are per-(i,t) observation-specific. The distance formula excludes the
target period t and uses only periods where both units are untreated (W=0).

*Special cases (Section 2.2):*
- λ_nn=∞, ω_j=θ_s=1 (uniform weights) → recovers DID/TWFE
- ω_j=θ_s=1, λ_nn<∞ → recovers Matrix Completion (Athey et al. 2021)
- λ_nn=∞ with specific ω_j, θ_s → recovers SC/SDID

*LOOCV tuning parameter selection (Equation 5, Footnote 2):*
```
Q(λ) = Σ_{j,s: D_js=0} [τ̂_js^loocv(λ)]²
```
- Score is **SUM** of squared pseudo-treatment effects on control observations
- **Two-stage procedure** (per paper's footnote 2):
  - Stage 1: Univariate grid searches with extreme fixed values
    - λ_time search: fix λ_unit=0, λ_nn=∞ (disabled)
    - λ_nn search: fix λ_time=0 (uniform time weights), λ_unit=0
    - λ_unit search: fix λ_nn=∞, λ_time=0
  - Stage 2: Cycling (coordinate descent) until convergence
- **"Disabled" parameter semantics** (per paper Section 4.3, Table 5, Footnote 2):
  - `λ_time=0`: Uniform time weights (disabled), because exp(-0 × dist) = 1
  - `λ_unit=0`: Uniform unit weights (disabled), because exp(-0 × dist) = 1
  - `λ_nn=∞`: Factor model disabled (L=0), because infinite penalty; converted to `1e10` internally
  - **Note**: `λ_nn=0` means NO regularization (full-rank L), which is the OPPOSITE of "disabled"
  - **Validation**: `lambda_time_grid` and `lambda_unit_grid` must not contain inf. A `ValueError` is raised if they do, guiding users to use 0.0 for uniform weights per Eq. 3.
- **LOOCV failure handling** (Equation 5 compliance):
  - If ANY LOOCV fit fails for a parameter combination, Q(λ) = ∞
  - A warning is emitted on the first failure with the observation (t, i) and λ values
  - Subsequent failures for the same λ are not individually warned (early return)
  - This ensures λ selection only considers fully estimable combinations

*Standard errors:*
- Block bootstrap preserving panel structure (Algorithm 3)

*Edge cases:*
- Rank selection: automatic via cross-validation, information criterion, or elbow
- Zero singular values: handled by soft-thresholding
- Extreme distances: weights regularized to prevent degeneracy
- LOOCV fit failures: returns Q(λ) = ∞ on first failure (per Equation 5 requirement that Q sums over ALL control observations where D==0); if all parameter combinations fail, falls back to defaults (1.0, 1.0, 0.1)
- **λ_nn=∞ implementation**: Only λ_nn uses infinity (converted to 1e10 for computation):
  - λ_nn=∞ → 1e10 (large penalty → L≈0, factor model disabled)
  - Conversion applied to grid values during LOOCV (including Rust backend)
  - Conversion applied to selected values for point estimation
  - Conversion applied to selected values for variance estimation (ensures SE matches ATT)
  - **Results storage**: `TROPResults` stores *original* λ_nn value (inf), while computations use 1e10. λ_time and λ_unit store their selected values directly (0.0 = uniform).
- **Empty control observations**: If no valid control observations exist, returns Q(λ) = ∞ with warning. A score of 0.0 would incorrectly "win" over legitimate parameters.
- **Infinite LOOCV score handling**: If best LOOCV score is infinite, `best_lambda` is set to None, triggering defaults fallback
- Validation: requires at least 2 periods before first treatment
- **D matrix validation**: Treatment indicator must be an absorbing state (monotonic non-decreasing per unit)
  - Detection: `np.diff(D, axis=0) < 0` for any column indicates violation
  - Handling: Raises `ValueError` with list of violating unit IDs and remediation guidance
  - Error message includes: "convert to absorbing state: D[t, i] = 1 for all t >= first treatment period"
  - **Rationale**: Event-style D (0→1→0) silently biases ATT; runtime validation prevents misuse
  - **Unbalanced panels**: Missing unit-period observations are allowed. Monotonicity validation checks each unit's *observed* D sequence for monotonicity, which correctly catches 1→0 violations that span missing period gaps (e.g., D[2]=1, missing [3,4], D[5]=0 is detected as a violation even though the gap hides the transition in adjacent-period checks).
  - **n_post_periods metadata**: Counts periods where D=1 is actually observed (at least one unit has D=1), not calendar periods from first treatment. In unbalanced panels where treated units are missing in some post-treatment periods, only periods with observed D=1 values are counted.
- Wrong D specification: if user provides event-style D (only first treatment period),
  the absorbing-state validation will raise ValueError with helpful guidance
- **LOOCV failure metadata**: When LOOCV fits fail in the Rust backend, the first failed observation coordinates (t, i) are returned to Python for informative warning messages

**Reference implementation(s):**
- Authors' replication code (forthcoming)

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Factor matrix estimated via soft-threshold SVD
- [x] Unit weights: `exp(-λ_unit × distance)` (unnormalized, matching Eq. 2)
- [x] LOOCV implemented for tuning parameter selection
- [x] LOOCV uses SUM of squared errors per Equation 5
- [x] Multiple rank selection methods: cv, ic, elbow
- [x] Returns factor loadings and scores for interpretation
- [x] ATT averages over all D==1 cells (general assignment patterns)
- [x] No post_periods parameter (D matrix determines treatment timing)
- [x] D matrix semantics documented (absorbing state, not event indicator)
- [x] Unbalanced panels supported (missing observations don't trigger false violations)

### TROP Joint Optimization Method

**Method**: `method="joint"` in TROP estimator

**Approach**: Joint weighted least squares with optional nuclear norm penalty.
Estimates fixed effects, factor matrix, and scalar treatment effect simultaneously.

**Objective function** (Equation J1):
```
min_{μ, α, β, L, τ}  Σ_{i,t} δ_{it} × (Y_{it} - μ - α_i - β_t - L_{it} - W_{it}×τ)² + λ_nn×||L||_*
```

where:
- δ_{it} = δ_time(t) × δ_unit(i) are observation weights (product of time and unit weights)
- μ is the intercept
- α_i are unit fixed effects
- β_t are time fixed effects
- L_{it} is the low-rank factor component
- τ is a **single scalar** (homogeneous treatment effect assumption)
- W_{it} is the treatment indicator

**Weight computation** (differs from twostep):
- Time weights: δ_time(t) = exp(-λ_time × |t - center|) where center = T - treated_periods/2
- Unit weights: δ_unit(i) = exp(-λ_unit × RMSE(i, treated_avg))
  where RMSE is computed over pre-treatment periods comparing to average treated trajectory

**Implementation approach** (without CVXPY):

1. **Without low-rank (λ_nn = ∞)**: Standard weighted least squares
   - Build design matrix with unit/time dummies + treatment indicator
   - Solve via iterative coordinate descent for (μ, α, β, τ)

2. **With low-rank (finite λ_nn)**: Alternating minimization
   - Alternate between:
     - Fix L, solve weighted LS for (μ, α, β, τ)
     - Fix (μ, α, β, τ), soft-threshold SVD for L (proximal step)
   - Continue until convergence

**LOOCV parameter selection** (unified with twostep, Equation 5):
Following paper's Equation 5 and footnote 2:
```
Q(λ) = Σ_{j,s: D_js=0} [τ̂_js^loocv(λ)]²
```
where τ̂_js^loocv is the pseudo-treatment effect at control observation (j,s)
with that observation excluded from fitting.

For joint method, LOOCV works as follows:
1. For each control observation (t, i):
   - Zero out weight δ_{ti} = 0 (exclude from weighted objective)
   - Fit joint model on remaining data → obtain (μ̂, α̂, β̂, L̂)
   - Compute pseudo-treatment: τ̂_{ti} = Y_{ti} - μ̂ - α̂_i - β̂_t - L̂_{ti}
2. Score = Σ τ̂_{ti}² (sum of squared pseudo-treatment effects)
3. Select λ combination that minimizes Q(λ)

**Rust acceleration**: The LOOCV grid search is parallelized in Rust for 5-10x speedup.
- `loocv_grid_search_joint()` - Parallel LOOCV across all λ combinations
- `bootstrap_trop_variance_joint()` - Parallel bootstrap variance estimation

**Key differences from twostep method**:
- Treatment effect τ is a single scalar (homogeneous assumption) vs. per-observation τ_{it}
- Global weights (distance to treated block center) vs. per-observation weights
- Single model fit per λ combination vs. N_treated fits
- Faster computation for large panels

**Assumptions**:
- **Simultaneous adoption (enforced)**: The joint method requires all treated units
  to receive treatment at the same time. A `ValueError` is raised if staggered
  adoption is detected (units first treated at different periods). Treatment timing is
  inferred once and held constant for bootstrap variance estimation.
  For staggered adoption designs, use `method="twostep"`.

**Reference**: Adapted from reference implementation. See also Athey et al. (2025).

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Same LOOCV framework as twostep (Equation 5)
- [x] Global weight computation using treated block center
- [x] Weighted least squares with treatment indicator
- [x] Alternating minimization for nuclear norm penalty
- [x] Returns scalar τ (homogeneous treatment effect)
- [x] Rust acceleration for LOOCV and bootstrap

# Diagnostics & Sensitivity

## PlaceboTests

**Module:** `diff_diff/diagnostics.py`

*Edge cases:*
- NaN inference for undefined statistics:
  - `permutation_test`: t_stat is NaN when permutation SE is zero (all permutations produce identical estimates)
  - `leave_one_out_test`: t_stat, p_value, CI are NaN when LOO SE is zero (all LOO effects identical)
  - **Note**: Defensive enhancement matching CallawaySantAnna NaN convention

## BaconDecomposition

**Primary source:** [Goodman-Bacon, A. (2021). Difference-in-differences with variation in treatment timing. *Journal of Econometrics*, 225(2), 254-277.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.03.014)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires variation in treatment timing (staggered adoption)
- Warns if only one treatment cohort (decomposition not meaningful)
- Assumes no never-treated: uses not-yet-treated as controls

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

TWFE decomposes as:
```
τ̂^TWFE = Σ_k s_k × τ̂_k
```
where k indexes 2×2 comparisons and s_k are Bacon weights.

Three comparison types:
1. **Treated vs. Never-treated** (if never-treated exist):
   ```
   τ̂_{T,U} = (Ȳ_{T,post} - Ȳ_{T,pre}) - (Ȳ_{U,post} - Ȳ_{U,pre})
   ```

2. **Earlier vs. Later-treated** (Earlier as treated, Later as control pre-treatment):
   ```
   τ̂_{k,l} = DiD using early-treated as treatment, late-treated as control
   ```

3. **Later vs. Earlier-treated** (problematic: uses post-treatment outcomes as control):
   ```
   τ̂_{l,k} = DiD using late-treated as treatment, early-treated (post) as control
   ```

Weights depend on group sizes and variance in treatment timing.

*Standard errors:*
- Not typically computed (decomposition is exact)
- Individual 2×2 estimates can have SEs

*Edge cases:*
- Continuous treatment: not supported, requires binary
- Weights may be negative for later-vs-earlier comparisons
- Single treatment time: no decomposition possible

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `bacondecomp::bacon()`
- Stata: `bacondecomp`

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] Three comparison types: treated_vs_never, earlier_vs_later, later_vs_earlier
- [ ] Weights sum to approximately 1 (numerical precision)
- [ ] TWFE coefficient ≈ weighted sum of 2×2 estimates
- [ ] Visualization shows weight vs. estimate by comparison type

## HonestDiD

**Primary source:** [Rambachan, A., & Roth, J. (2023). A More Credible Approach to Parallel Trends. *Review of Economic Studies*, 90(5), 2555-2591.](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdad018)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires event-study estimates with pre-treatment coefficients
- Warns if pre-treatment coefficients suggest parallel trends violation
- M=0 corresponds to exact parallel trends assumption

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

Identified set under smoothness restriction (Δ^SD):
```
Δ^SD(M) = {δ : |δ_t - δ_{t-1}| ≤ M for all pre-treatment t}
```

Identified set under relative magnitudes (Δ^RM):
```
Δ^RM(M̄) = {δ : |δ_post| ≤ M̄ × max_t |δ_t^pre|}
```

Bounds computed via linear programming:
```
[τ_L, τ_U] = [min_δ∈Δ τ(δ), max_δ∈Δ τ(δ)]
```

Confidence intervals:
- FLCI (Fixed-Length Confidence Interval) for smoothness
- C-LF (Conditional Least-Favorable) for relative magnitudes

*Standard errors:*
- Inherits from underlying event-study estimation
- Sensitivity analysis reports bounds, not point estimates

*Edge cases:*
- Breakdown point: smallest M where CI includes zero
- M=0: reduces to standard parallel trends
- Negative M: not valid (constraints become infeasible)

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `HonestDiD` package (Rambachan & Roth's official package)

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] M parameter must be ≥ 0
- [ ] Breakdown point (breakdown_M) correctly identified
- [ ] Delta^SD (smoothness) and Delta^RM (relative magnitudes) both supported
- [ ] Sensitivity plot shows bounds vs. M
- [ ] FLCI and C-LF confidence intervals implemented

## PreTrendsPower

**Primary source:** [Roth, J. (2022). Pretest with Caution: Event-Study Estimates after Testing for Parallel Trends. *American Economic Review: Insights*, 4(3), 305-322.](https://doi.org/10.1257/aeri.20210236)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires specification of variance-covariance matrix of pre-treatment estimates
- Warns if pre-trends test has low power (uninformative)
- Different violation types have different power properties

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

Pre-trends test statistic (Wald):
```
W = δ̂_pre' V̂_pre^{-1} δ̂_pre ~ χ²(k)
```

Power function:
```
Power(δ_true) = P(W > χ²_{α,k} | δ = δ_true)
```

Minimum detectable violation (MDV):
```
MDV(power=0.8) = min{|δ| : Power(δ) ≥ 0.8}
```

Violation types:
- **Linear**: δ_t = c × t (linear pre-trend)
- **Constant**: δ_t = c (level shift)
- **Last period**: δ_{-1} = c, others zero
- **Custom**: user-specified pattern

*Standard errors:*
- Power calculations are exact (no sampling variability)
- Uncertainty comes from estimated Σ

*Edge cases:*
- Perfect collinearity in pre-periods: test not well-defined
- Single pre-period: power calculation trivial
- Very high power: MDV approaches zero

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `pretrends` package (Roth's official package)

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] MDV = minimum detectable violation at target power level
- [ ] Violation types: linear, constant, last_period, custom all implemented
- [ ] Power curve plotting over violation magnitudes
- [ ] Integrates with HonestDiD for combined sensitivity analysis

- Burlig, F., Preonas, L., & Woerman, M. (2020). Panel Data and Experimental Design. *Journal of Development Economics*, 144, 102458.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires specification of outcome variance and intraclass correlation
- Warns if power is very low (<0.5) or sample size insufficient
- Cluster randomization requires cluster-level parameters

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

Minimum detectable effect (MDE):
```
MDE = (t_{α/2} + t_{1-κ}) × SE(τ̂)
```
where κ is target power (typically 0.8).

Standard error for DiD:
```
SE(τ̂) = σ × √(1/n_T + 1/n_C) × √(1 + ρ(m-1)) / √(1 - R²)
```
where:
- ρ = intraclass correlation
- m = cluster size
- R² = variance explained by covariates

Power function:
```
Power = Φ(|τ|/SE - z_{α/2})
```

Sample size for target power:
```
n = 2(t_{α/2} + t_{1-κ})² σ² / MDE²
```

*Standard errors:*
- Analytical formulas (no estimation uncertainty in power calculation)
- Simulation-based power accounts for finite-sample and model-specific factors

*Edge cases:*
- Very small effects: may require infeasibly large samples
- High ICC: dramatically reduces effective sample size
- Unequal allocation: optimal is often 50-50 but depends on costs

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `pwr` package (general), `DeclareDesign` (simulation-based)
- Stata: `power` command

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] MDE calculation given sample size and variance parameters
- [ ] Power calculation given effect size and sample size
- [ ] Sample size calculation given MDE and target power
- [ ] Simulation-based power for complex designs
- [ ] Cluster adjustment for clustered designs

# Visualization

## Event Study Plotting (`plot_event_study`)

**Reference Period Normalization**

Normalization only occurs when `reference_period` is **explicitly specified** by the user:

- **Explicit `reference_period=X`**: Normalizes effects (subtracts ref effect), sets ref SE to NaN
  - Point estimates: `effect_normalized = effect - effect_ref`
  - Reference period SE → NaN (it's now a constraint, not an estimate)
  - Other periods' SEs unchanged (uncertainty relative to the constraint)
  - CIs recomputed from normalized effects and original SEs

- **Auto-inferred reference** (from CallawaySantAnna results): Hollow marker styling only, no normalization
  - Original effects are plotted unchanged
  - Reference period shown with hollow marker for visual indication
  - All periods retain their original SEs and error bars

This design prevents unintended normalization when the reference period isn't a true
identifying constraint (e.g., CallawaySantAnna with `base_period="varying"` where different
cohorts use different comparison periods).

The explicit-only normalization follows the `fixest` (R) convention where the omitted/reference
category is an identifying constraint with no associated uncertainty. Auto-inferred references
follow the `did` (R) package convention which does not normalize and reports full inference.

**Rationale**: When normalizing to a reference period, we're treating that period as an
identifying constraint (effect ≡ 0 by definition). The variance of a constant is zero,
but since it's a constraint rather than an estimated quantity, we report NaN rather than 0.
Auto-inferred references may not represent true identifying constraints, so normalization
should be a deliberate user choice.

**Edge Cases:**
- If `reference_period` not in data: No normalization applied
- If reference effect is NaN: No normalization applied
- Reference period CI becomes (NaN, NaN) after normalization (explicit only)
- Reference period is plotted with hollow marker (both explicit and auto-inferred)
- Reference period error bars: removed for explicit, retained for auto-inferred

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `fixest::coefplot()` with reference category shown at 0 with no CI
- R: `did::ggdid()` does not normalize; shows full inference for all periods
