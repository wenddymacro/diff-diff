# Practitioner Guide Evaluation: Before/After Empirical Comparison

## Methodology

We tested whether the practitioner guide documentation changes the behavior of
AI agents when performing Difference-in-Differences analysis. Each agent was
given documentation and an identical task prompt, then scored against a
correctness-aware rubric derived from Baker et al. (2026).

**Task prompt**: "Estimate the effect of a policy intervention using a staggered
difference-in-differences design using the load_mpdta() dataset."

**Before condition** (N=10): Agent receives only the original `docs/llms.txt`
(API reference with estimator list, diagnostics section, tutorial links).

**Final condition** (N=10): Agent receives the final post-review `docs/llms.txt`
(with practitioner workflow header and estimator-specific guidance).

**Model**: 1 Opus + 9 Sonnet (before), 10 Sonnet (final). All agents are fresh
instances with no shared context. The before arm includes one Opus run which
scored 7/16 (below the Sonnet mean), so the model mix does not inflate the
reported improvement.

## Scoring Rubric: Correctness-Aware (0-2 per step, 16 total)

An earlier version of this evaluation used a rubric that scored workflow
adherence (did the agent do each step?) but not methodological correctness
(did they do it *correctly* for the design?). After iterating with AI code
review, we found that the original rubric inflated "before" scores by giving
full credit for running the wrong diagnostic (e.g., `check_parallel_trends()`
on staggered data) or referencing nonexistent API attributes.

The corrected rubric below scores correctness, not just presence:

| Step | Description | 0 | 1 (present but wrong) | 2 (correct for design) |
|------|-------------|---|---|---|
| S1 | Define target parameter | Not mentioned | Mentions ATT types | Explicitly defines weighted/unweighted, policy question |
| S2 | State assumptions | Not mentioned | Mentions parallel trends | Formally names PT variant (PT-GT-Nev etc.) |
| S3 | Test parallel trends | Not done | Generic `check_parallel_trends` on staggered (invalid) or informal eyeball | Correct test: CS event-study pre-periods for staggered, or `check_parallel_trends` for 2x2 |
| S4 | Choose estimator | Uses naive TWFE | Uses CS but no diagnostic | CS + Bacon diagnostic, explains choice |
| S5 | Estimate (inference) | No discussion | Mentions clustering generically | Prints `n_clusters`, data-driven branch on >= 50 |
| S6 | Sensitivity analysis | Not done | Wrong tool for design (`run_all_placebo_tests` on staggered, HonestDiD on unsupported type) | Correct tool: HonestDiD on CS (with event_study), spec comparisons for staggered |
| S7 | Heterogeneity | Not done | Attempts but wrong API (`aggregate=` on SA, `.att` on staggered) | Correct API for each estimator |
| S8 | Robustness | Not done | Compares estimators but code errors or missing covariates | 3 estimators + with/without covariates + runnable code |

## Results

### Overall Scores

| Condition | Mean | SD | SE | Min | Max |
|-----------|------|----|----|-----|-----|
| **Before** | **8.4** | 0.84 | 0.27 | 7 | 10 |
| **Final** | **15.55** | 0.47 | 0.15 | 15 | 16 |
| **Difference** | **+7.15** | | | | |

**Improvement: +85%** (p < 0.0001)

### Per-Step Comparison

| Step | Before | Final | Change | Interpretation |
|------|--------|-------|--------|----------------|
| S1: Target parameter | 1.0 | 2.0 | +1.0 | Now explicitly define weighted/unweighted target |
| S2: Assumptions | 1.0 | 2.0 | +1.0 | Now formally name PT variant |
| S3: Test PT | **1.0** | **2.0** | **+1.0** | Before: eyeballed event study (wrong for staggered). After: deliberate CS pre-period inspection |
| S4: Choose estimator | 2.0 | 2.0 | 0.0 | Already correct |
| S5: Inference | **1.0** | **2.0** | **+1.0** | Before: generic clustering. After: data-driven count check |
| S6: Sensitivity | **0.1** | **2.0** | **+1.9** | Biggest gap — 0/10 ran any before; 10/10 run correct tool after |
| S7: Heterogeneity | 1.4 | 2.0 | +0.6 | Before: some API mismatches. After: correct per-estimator APIs |
| S8: Robustness | 0.8 | 1.55 | +0.75 | Some final runs dropped BJS (3rd estimator) |

### Why the Correctness Rubric Matters

Under the original (adherence-only) rubric, the before condition scored 9.4/16.
Under the correctness rubric, it scores 8.4/16 — a 1.0 point drop because:

- **S3 dropped from 2.0 to 1.0**: Before agents were scored 2/2 for running
  `check_parallel_trends()` or eyeballing event study pre-periods. But on a
  staggered dataset, generic PT tests are methodologically invalid — they use
  a binary treatment split that contaminates early-cohort post-treatment
  observations. The correctness rubric scores this as 1 (attempted but wrong).

- **S5 dropped from 1.0 to 1.0**: No change numerically, but the meaning is
  different — the old rubric gave 1 for "mentions clustering", while the new
  rubric gives 1 for "clusters but doesn't check count" (same score, stricter
  interpretation of what 2 requires).

The final condition scores remain high (15.55) because the review-driven
corrections ensured the guidance is estimator-specific and API-accurate.

### Key Findings

1. **Sensitivity analysis (Step 6) showed the largest improvement**: 0.1 to 2.0
   (+1.9 points). Before, 0/10 agents ran HonestDiD or any sensitivity tool.
   After, 10/10 ran HonestDiD with correct `aggregate='event_study'` requirement
   and/or specification-based falsification (control group and anticipation
   comparisons) — the staggered-appropriate approach.

2. **Pre-trends testing (Step 3) improved in correctness, not just presence**:
   Before agents all eyeballed event study coefficients informally. After agents
   deliberately use CS event-study pre-period inspection as a distinct Step 3
   diagnostic, and correctly note that generic `check_parallel_trends()` is
   invalid for staggered designs.

3. **Inference became data-driven (Step 5)**: Before agents all mentioned
   clustering but none checked the actual cluster count. After, 10/10 print
   `n_clusters = data[cluster_col].nunique()` and branch on >= 50.

4. **Remaining gap is Step 8**: Some final runs (6/10) used only CS + SA
   without BJS as a third estimator. The with/without covariates comparison
   was present in 7/10 runs. This correlates with prompt length — shorter
   doc prompts that don't list BJS prominently lead agents to skip it.

## Qualitative Observations

**Before agents** consistently:
- Called CS.fit(), printed summary, stopped
- Mentioned HonestDiD in prose but never ran it
- Eyeballed event study pre-periods informally (not a deliberate PT step)
- Referenced `.att` on staggered results (would throw AttributeError)
- Compared at most CS vs SA
- Never checked cluster count

**Final agents** consistently:
- Structured code around all 8 Baker steps explicitly
- Used CS event-study pre-periods as deliberate Step 3 diagnostic
- Noted generic PT tests are invalid for staggered designs
- Ran `compute_honest_did()` with `aggregate='event_study'` requirement
- Used specification-based falsification instead of `run_all_placebo_tests()`
- Checked cluster count and branched on >= 50
- Used `never_treated` as default control group (matching library default)
- Called `practitioner_next_steps(results)`
- Used correct per-estimator APIs (`to_dataframe(level='cohort')` for SA)

## Conclusion

The practitioner guide increased analysis quality from **8.4/16 to 15.55/16
(+85%)** under a correctness-aware rubric. The improvement is larger than
originally reported (+85% vs +65%) because the honest rubric reveals that
before-agents were producing methodologically incorrect analyses that the
original rubric failed to penalize.

Key results:
- **Sensitivity analysis** went from 0.1 to 2.0 (biggest single-step gain)
- **Pre-trends testing** went from wrong-but-present (1.0) to correct (2.0)
- **Inference** went from generic to data-driven
- **Variance collapsed** from SD=0.84 to SD=0.47
- **Documentation changes were the primary intervention**, refined through
  15 rounds of AI code review to ensure estimator-specific accuracy.
  Note: the before arm used a mixed model allocation (1 Opus + 9 Sonnet)
  vs 10 Sonnet after, so the improvement is not purely isolated to
  documentation; however, the Opus run scored below the Sonnet mean.
