## Current Status

diff-diff v2.4.1 is a **production-ready** DiD library with feature parity with R's `did` + `HonestDiD` + `synthdid` ecosystem for core DiD analysis:

- **Core estimators**: Basic DiD, TWFE, MultiPeriod, Callaway-Sant'Anna, Sun-Abraham, Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess Imputation, Synthetic DiD, Triple Difference (DDD), TROP, Two-Stage DiD (Gardner 2022), Stacked DiD (Wing et al. 2024)
- **Valid inference**: Robust SEs, cluster SEs, wild bootstrap, multiplier bootstrap, placebo-based variance
- **Assumption diagnostics**: Parallel trends tests, placebo tests, Goodman-Bacon decomposition
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Honest DiD (Rambachan-Roth), Pre-trends power analysis (Roth 2022)
- **Study design**: Power analysis tools
- **Data utilities**: Real-world datasets (Card-Krueger, Castle Doctrine, Divorce Laws, MPDTA), DGP functions for all supported designs
- **Performance**: Optional Rust backend for accelerated computation; faster than R at scale (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for benchmarks)

## Near-Term Enhancements (v2.5)

High-value additions building on our existing foundation.

### ~~Stacked Difference-in-Differences~~ (Implemented in v2.5)

Implemented as `StackedDiD`. See `diff_diff/stacked_did.py`.

### Staggered Triple Difference (DDD)

Extend the existing `TripleDifference` estimator to handle staggered adoption settings. The current implementation handles 2-period DDD; this extends to multi-period designs.

**Multi-period/Staggered Support:**
- Group-time ATT(g,t) for DDD designs with variation in treatment timing
- Handle settings where groups adopt at different times
- Multiple comparison groups (never-treated, not-yet-treated in either dimension)
- `StaggeredTripleDifference` class or extended `TripleDifference` with `first_treat` parameter

**Event Study Aggregation:**
- Dynamic treatment effects over time (event study coefficients)
- Pre-treatment placebo effects for parallel trends assessment
- `aggregate='event_study'` parameter like `CallawaySantAnna`
- Integration with `plot_event_study()` visualization

**Multiplier Bootstrap Inference:**
- Multiplier bootstrap for valid inference in staggered settings
- Rademacher, Mammen, and Webb weight options (matching existing estimators)
- `n_bootstrap` parameter and `DDDBootstrapResults` class
- Clustered bootstrap for panel data

**Reference**: [Ortiz-Villavicencio & Sant'Anna (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09942). *Working Paper*. R package: `triplediff`.

### Enhanced Visualization

- Synthetic control weight visualization (bar chart of unit weights)
- Treatment adoption "staircase" plot for staggered designs
- Interactive plots with plotly backend option

---

## Medium-Term Enhancements (v2.5+)

Extending diff-diff to handle more complex settings.

### Continuous Treatment DiD

Many treatments have dose/intensity rather than binary on/off. Active research area with recent breakthroughs.

- Treatment effect on treated (ATT) parameters under generalized parallel trends
- Dose-response curves and marginal effects
- Handle settings where "dose" varies across units and time
- Event studies with continuous treatments

### de Chaisemartin-D'Haultfœuille Estimator

Handles treatment that switches on and off (reversible treatments), unlike most other methods.

- Allows units to move into and out of treatment
- Time-varying, heterogeneous treatment effects
- Comparison with never-switchers or flexible control groups
- Different assumptions than CS/SA—useful for different settings

**Reference**: [de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfœuille (2020, 2024)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3980758). *American Economic Review*.

### Local Projections DiD

Implements local projections for dynamic treatment effects. Doesn't require specifying full dynamic structure.

- Flexible impulse response estimation
- Robust to misspecification of dynamics
- Natural handling of anticipation effects
- Growing use in macroeconomics and policy evaluation

**Reference**: Dube, Girardi, Jordà, and Taylor (2023).

### Nonlinear DiD

For outcomes where linear models are inappropriate (binary, count, bounded).

- Logit/probit DiD for binary outcomes
- Poisson DiD for count outcomes
- Flexible strategies for staggered designs with nonlinear models
- Proper handling of incidence rate ratios and odds ratios

**Reference**: [Wooldridge (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/ectj/article/26/3/C31/7250479). *The Econometrics Journal*.

### Doubly Robust DiD + Synthetic Control

Unified framework combining DiD and synthetic control with doubly robust identification—valid under *either* parallel trends or synthetic control assumptions.

- ATT identified under parallel trends OR group-level SC condition
- Semiparametric estimation framework
- Multiplier bootstrap for valid inference under either assumption
- Strengthens credibility by avoiding the DiD vs. SC trade-off

**Reference**: [Sun, Xie & Zhang (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11375). *Working Paper*.

### Causal Duration Analysis with DiD

Extends DiD to duration/survival outcomes where standard methods fail (hazard rates, time-to-event).

- Duration analogue of parallel trends on hazard rates
- Avoids distributional assumptions and hazard function specification
- Visual and formal pre-trends assessment for duration data
- Handles absorbing states approaching probability bounds

## Long-Term Research Directions (v3.0+)

Frontier methods requiring more research investment.

### Matrix Completion Methods

Unified framework encompassing synthetic control and regression approaches. Moves seamlessly between cross-sectional and time-series patterns.

- Nuclear norm regularization for low-rank structure
- Handles missing data patterns common in panel settings
- Bridges synthetic control (few units, many periods) and regression (many units, few periods)
- Confidence intervals via debiasing

**Reference**: [Athey et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10251). *Journal of the American Statistical Association*.

### Causal Forests for DiD

Machine learning methods for discovering heterogeneous treatment effects in DiD settings.

- Estimate treatment effect heterogeneity across covariates
- Data-driven subgroup discovery
- Combine with DiD identification for observational data
- Honest confidence intervals for discovered heterogeneity

### Double/Debiased ML for DiD

For high-dimensional settings with many potential confounders.

- ML for nuisance parameter estimation (propensity, outcome models)
- Cross-fitting for valid inference
- Handles many covariates without overfitting concerns
- Doubly-robust estimation with ML flexibility

**Reference**: Chernozhukov et al. (2018). *The Econometrics Journal*.

### Alternative Inference Methods

- **Randomization inference**: Exact p-values for small samples
- **Bayesian DiD**: Priors on parallel trends violations
- **Conformal inference**: Prediction intervals with finite-sample guarantees
